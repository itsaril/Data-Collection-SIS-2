We chose eBay (https://www.ebay.com) because it meets all requirements of the assignment:
It is a dynamic, JavaScript-rendered website
Product lists update dynamically
Many items load via lazy loading / infinite scroll
Product cards contain structured fields suitable for scraping

The scraper collects product information based on any search query (e.g., "laptop"), including:
title
price & currency
condition (new / used / refurbished)
seller name
item location
shipping cost
rating & review count
specifications (JSON if available)
product URL
timestamp

The final cleaned dataset contains at least 100 valid products, as required.
